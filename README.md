üìÇ Project Workflow

1.The project followed a structured pipeline, beginning with data cleaning and feature engineering in Python (Pandas).

2.The clean data was then loaded into an SQLite database for Exploratory Data Analysis using SQL to answer key business questions about sales, profit, including RFM and cohort analysis.

3.Subsequently, three machine learning models were developed in Python: K-Means for customer segmentation, Prophet for sales forecasting, and a Random Forest Classifier (using SMOTE to handle imbalance) for profitability prediction. 

4.The final insights from all stages were consolidated and presented in a multi-page, interactive Power BI dashboard.
