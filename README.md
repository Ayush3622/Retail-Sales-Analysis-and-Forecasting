Retail Profitability and Customer Segmentation AnalysisA complete, end-to-end data analytics project using SQL for deep-dive querying, Python for advanced machine learning, and Power BI for interactive visualization. The project analyzes the Superstore dataset to uncover key drivers of profitability, segment high-value customers, and forecast future sales.üìä Interactive Power BI DashboardThe final output of this project is a comprehensive, multi-page interactive dashboard. It summarizes the key findings and allows for dynamic exploration of the data.‚û°Ô∏è View the Live Dashboard Here(Screenshot of the Executive Summary Page)üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackData Storage & Querying: SQLiteData Analysis & Modeling: PythonLibraries: Pandas (Data Manipulation), Scikit-learn (Clustering & Classification), imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), Prophet (Forecasting), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)Business Intelligence & Visualization: Power BIüìÇ Project WorkflowThis project follows a structured, multi-stage workflow, moving from data preparation and querying to advanced modeling and final visualization. Each stage is handled in a separate, modular Jupyter Notebook.Step 1: Data Preparation & Cleaning (01_Data_Preparation.ipynb)Loaded the raw Superstore dataset using Pandas.Performed initial data profiling to identify duplicates, missing values, and incorrect data types.Actions Taken:Removed duplicate entries.Standardized column names to a consistent format (lowercase with underscores).Converted date columns (order_date, ship_date) to the proper datetime format.Engineered new features for deeper analysis, such as order_year, order_month, and shipping_time_days.Output: A clean, analysis-ready CSV file (cleaned_superstore.csv) to serve as a single source of truth for all subsequent steps.Step 2: SQL Database Analysis (02_SQL_Analysis.ipynb)Imported the cleaned data into a persistent SQLite database.Performed foundational Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL to answer key business questions about sales, profit, and customer behavior.Conducted advanced SQL analysis, including:RFM Analysis: Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer to prepare for segmentation.Cohort Analysis: Analyzed customer retention rates over time to understand long-term engagement.Output: An RFM analysis table (rfm_analysis.csv) for use in the machine learning stage.Step 3: Python Analysis & Machine Learning (03_Python_Analysis_ML.ipynb)This stage involved building three distinct machine learning models to uncover deeper insights.Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering):Used the RFM data from the SQL analysis.Scaled the features using StandardScaler and applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K=4).Grouped customers into four meaningful segments: Champions, Loyal Customers, Needs Attention, and Lost Customers.Sales Forecasting (Time Series with Prophet):Aggregated sales data to a monthly level.Built a time series model using Facebook's Prophet library to forecast total sales for the next 12 months, capturing yearly seasonality.Profitability Prediction (Random Forest Classifier):Engineered a binary target variable is_profitable.Built a classification model to predict whether an order would be profitable based on features like discount, sales, category, and region.Addressed class imbalance in the training data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create a more balanced dataset, which improved the model's ability to identify unprofitable orders.Step 4: Power BI VisualizationConnected Power BI to the cleaned dataset and the customer segmentation results.Created a three-page interactive report to tell a compelling business story:Executive Summary: A high-level overview of KPIs, sales/profit trends, and regional performance.Profitability Deep Dive: An investigative page to identify the root causes of unprofitability, highlighting the negative impact of high discounts on specific sub-categories.Customer Intelligence: A visualization of the machine learning outputs, showing the value of each customer segment and the future sales forecast.üí° Key Insights & RecommendationsThe Discount Trap: High discounts are the single largest driver of unprofitability. The Furniture category, particularly Tables and Bookcases, suffers from high average discounts, leading to significant financial losses despite strong sales.Recommendation: Implement a cap on discount rates for historically unprofitable sub-categories. Explore bundling strategies instead of direct price cuts.The Power of Champions: The "Champions" and "Loyal Customers" segments, while representing less than 25% of the customer base, are responsible for over 65% of total sales.Recommendation: Launch a targeted loyalty program and exclusive offers for these high-value segments to maximize retention and lifetime value.Nurture the "Needs Attention" Segment: This segment consists of recent customers who have low frequency and monetary value. They represent a key opportunity for growth.Recommendation: Develop a targeted email marketing campaign to encourage repeat purchases and introduce them to higher-margin products.
